## Implementation approach

We will use Flask as our web framework due to its simplicity and flexibility. SQLAlchemy will be used as the ORM for database operations. For the recruitment and training process, we will use the open-source human resource management system OrangeHRM. The marketing strategy will be implemented using the open-source marketing automation software Mautic. All these tools are open-source and widely used in the industry. The difficult points in the requirements are the establishment of a recruitment and training process and the development of a marketing strategy. These will be addressed by integrating OrangeHRM and Mautic into our system.

## Anything UNCLEAR

The specific responsibilities of the catboys and the type of restaurants that the service will be offered to are unclear. More information is needed to define these aspects in the system.
