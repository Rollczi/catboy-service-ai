## Logic Analysis

- ['main.py', 'Contains the main entry point of the application. It should initialize Flask, SQLAlchemy, OrangeHRM, and Mautic, and register the routes for the API endpoints.']
- ['models.py', 'Contains the SQLAlchemy models for Restaurant, Service, and Catboy. It should also contain the logic for adding a service to a restaurant and assigning a catboy to a service.']
- ['views.py', 'Contains the Flask views for the API endpoints. It should use the models to create restaurants, services, and catboys, and to add services to restaurants and assign catboys to services.']
- ['forms.py', 'Contains the Flask-WTF forms for the API endpoints. It should validate the data for creating restaurants, services, and catboys.']
- ['config.py', 'Contains the configuration for Flask, SQLAlchemy, OrangeHRM, and Mautic. It should be loaded by main.py at startup.']

## Task list

- config.py
- main.py
- models.py
- forms.py
- views.py

## Shared Knowledge


        'config.py' contains the configuration for Flask, SQLAlchemy, OrangeHRM, and Mautic. It should be loaded by 'main.py' at startup. 'main.py' initializes Flask, SQLAlchemy, OrangeHRM, and Mautic, and registers the routes for the API endpoints. 'models.py' contains the SQLAlchemy models for Restaurant, Service, and Catboy, and the logic for adding a service to a restaurant and assigning a catboy to a service. 'forms.py' validates the data for creating restaurants, services, and catboys. 'views.py' uses the models to create restaurants, services, and catboys, and to add services to restaurants and assign catboys to services.
    

## Anything UNCLEAR

The specific responsibilities of the catboys and the type of restaurants that the service will be offered to are unclear. More information is needed to define these aspects in the system.
